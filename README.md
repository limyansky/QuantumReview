# Quantum Review

I review my knowledge of quantum mechanics, but make use of Mathematica to do so. 

I will follow along with these sources: 
**Using Mathematica for Quantum Mechanics** _A Student's Manual_ by Roman Schmied
https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.7050

_Lecture Notes on the Theory of Open Quantum Systems_ by Daniel A. Lidar
https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00967

Mathematica notebooks are saved as AuthorLastName_Chapter.nb.
I attempt to provide updated PDFs of these notebooks, too.
